# flask-api-benchmark
This repo houses the worlds simplest flask API along with Docker files to deploy said app in multiple ways, and benchmarking tools to measure which method is the best!

# Credit where credit is due.
A large part of the `Dockerfile` was lifted from [tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-docker](https://github.com/tiangolo/uwsgi-nginx-docker) so I'd like to give a big shout out to [@tiangolo](https://github.com/tiangolo) for figuring out a fairly minimal install of Nginx & uwsgi.
